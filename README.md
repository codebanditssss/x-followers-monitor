### 4. Obtain X (Twitter) Cookies

- Install the [Cookie-Editor](https://cookie-editor.cgagnier.ca/) browser extension.

### 5. Set Environment Variables

- **Required:**
  - `X_USERNAME`: Your X (Twitter) username (without @)
  - `X_COOKIES`: Paste your cookies JSON as a string (must be exported as JSON from Cookie-Editor)
- **Optional:**
  - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: Your Discord webhook URL to receive follower updates

**Example (Windows):**

```bash
set X_USERNAME=your_username
set X_COOKIES={...your_cookies_json...}
set DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url
```

**Example (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
export X_USERNAME=your_username
export X_COOKIES='{...your_cookies_json...}'

## üîî Discord Webhook Integration

- If you set the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable, the script will post follower changes to your Discord channel after each run.
- The webhook message includes new followers, unfollowers, and net change.
- You can create a webhook in your Discord server settings (Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks > New Webhook).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced: GitHub Actions Setup

1. Go to your repository's **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**.
2. Add the following secrets (all required except webhook):
   - `X_COOKIES`: Your cookies JSON string (required)
   - `X_USERNAME`: Your X username (required)
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional): Your Discord webhook URL
3. The workflow will run automatically every 6 hours or can be triggered manually from the Actions tab.

## üì¶ Output Files

- `followers_data.json`: Current snapshot of your followers
- `followers_history/`: Directory containing historical data
  - `latest.json`: Most recent follower data

## üìù Notes

- Never commit your `cookies.json` file or secrets to version control.
- If you see login errors, refresh your cookies.
- If selectors break, X (Twitter) may have changed their frontend; update selectors in `main.py`.
